"""
The agent's reasoning loop, built with LangGraph.

This is the piece that makes this a genuine *agent* rather than a
request/response wrapper around an LLM. A plain LLM call takes a prompt
and returns text -- it can't act. This graph gives the model a loop:

    1. Look at the conversation so far.
    2. Decide: can I answer directly, or do I need a tool?
    3. If a tool is needed, call it, feed the result back in, and go to 1.
    4. Once no more tools are needed, return the final answer.

That loop -- "keep calling tools until the task is actually done" -- is
what "agentic" means in practice. LangGraph represents this as a small
graph of nodes ("agent" and "tools") with an edge that keeps routing
back to the agent node until it decides to stop.
