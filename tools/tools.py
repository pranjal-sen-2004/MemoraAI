"""
Tools the agent can call. Each one is a plain Python function wrapped
with LangChain's @tool decorator, which auto-generates the JSON schema
the LLM needs to know *when* and *how* to call it -- this is the same
mechanism that underlies MCP tool definitions, just without the extra
process boundary. (See tools/mcp_server.py for the MCP-wrapped version
of these same tools, exposed over the actual MCP protocol.)

Keeping the tool logic here, separate from the MCP transport layer,
means the same functions are usable directly (fast, in-process) or via
MCP (standardised, swappable) without duplicating logic.
